# Python-dictionary-textfile-picklebinary-
Python program that was written for class to read a text file and sort data using Nation objects stored in a dictionary. 
For practice, the dictionary was stored into a pickled binary file and then read from the pickled binary file. 
Through this excercise I learned how useful dictionaries can be (especially nested dictionaries), 
and I also learned that binary files can be used for long term, compressed storage of objects.)
